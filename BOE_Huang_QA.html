        <h2>Vision &amp; Priorities</h2>
        <p class="lead">Since January 2024, our school district has gone through a period of notable change. Several longtime administrators, including the superintendent, the high school principal and vice principal, and multiple elementary school principals, have moved on to other opportunities. Additionally, teacher turnover has noticeably increased. The district has also updated how certain roles and responsibilities, mainly related to department chair and instructional supervisor positions, are organized. Recent enrollment reports show an increase in transfers to private school, particularly after 8th grade.</p>
        <p>Change on this scale can bring both promising opportunities and genuine challenges. It is a chance to try new approaches, but it also requires thoughtful planning to ensure transitions are smooth, and the focus remains on students and student achievement. If elected, I will work to help the district navigate these changes with transparency, collaboration and a steady commitment to maintaining the quality of education that draws families to Millburn.</p>

        <h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
        <p>As a Millburn parent with a child in high school, I understand firsthand the importance of balancing academic achievement with students’ health and well-being. Our schools must continue to uphold the quality and rigor that prepare students for success in college and beyond, while also fostering good habits, resilience, and a lifelong love of learning.</p>

        <h3>Governance Focus</h3>
        <p>My priorities focus on setting up strong and effective governance with accountable oversight for our schools: <strong>Transparency, Accountability, Communication, and Collaboration</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transparent, accountable decision-making:</strong> Ensure important decisions follow a clear, inclusive process by incorporating input from educators, families, and students, and by considering the full impact on classrooms. The process for addressing issues and identifying solutions should be based on rigorous, thorough, and sound professional research and analysis. Significant changes should be well communicated in advance, and stakeholder buy-in should be sought to the greatest extent possible before implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>Stability and continuity:</strong> Support stability for our schools and students during transitions so teaching and learning quality remain high. During periods of change, teachers’ and students’ experiences can be overlooked; we must listen closely to concerns and ensure adjustments lead to positive results and improved placements over the long term. Every student—from those with exceptional academic abilities to those requiring additional support or special education services—should have an environment in which they can thrive and reach their full potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Open communication &amp; measurable progress:</strong> Provide clear explanations for decisions, invite feedback from all stakeholders, and measure progress with tangible metrics such as student outcomes, staff retention, enrollment trends, and other key indicators. We should welcome concerns and differing perspectives—and even constructive debate—as they can lead to better decisions and more sustainable results when addressed openly and respectfully.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>Millburn’s excellence is built on the dedication of our educators, administrators, and families. I am grateful for the opportunities the district has provided my son, and seeing his positive growth has encouraged me to give back to our community. My goal is to protect that tradition while embracing opportunities to make our schools even stronger. <em>Building Trust Together</em>—for our schools, our teachers, and our students.</blockquote>

      <div class="a">
        <h2>Professional Background &amp; Transferable Skills</h2>
        <p class="lead">To be effective, BOE members need broad and deep skills to navigate policymaking, oversight, budget planning, and strategic decision‑making while ensuring that students receive a high‑quality education. Millburn is a high‑performing district with multiple schools, hundreds of staff, and a substantial annual budget, so the Board’s work requires both big‑picture vision and attention to detail.</p>
        <p>I have spent about twenty years working in the highly regulated and complex financial industry, including management roles in risk management. Over my career, I have developed a diverse skill set that includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strategic and systems thinking:</strong> seeing the big picture while understanding how the moving parts fit together.</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership and people management:</strong> building coalitions across a wide range of stakeholders and guiding high‑performing teams.</li>
          <li><strong>Change management:</strong> leading organizational transformations and culture shifts.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk, compliance, and governance:</strong> ensuring adherence to rules, regulations, policies, and ethical standards, and creating systems to strengthen them.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational excellence:</strong> using data and metrics to evaluate performance and guide decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the same skills that an effective BOE member must bring to the role. They will help me contribute meaningfully to maintaining and improving Millburn’s tradition of excellence while <em>building trust together</em> for our schools, our teachers, and our students.</p>
