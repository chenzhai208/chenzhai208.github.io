  <h1>Board of Education Candidate Q&amp;A</h1>

  <div class="qa">
    <div class="question">TAP: What do you want to do for the Board of Education?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>So much progress has been made in our district in recent years, and our responsibility now is to build on that momentum. We must ensure that every student has access to opportunities that reflect their individual strengths and needs; this includes appropriately leveled courses, grading systems that reflect mastery, and strong support for social-emotional growth.</p>
      <p>As a Board of Education member, my top priorities would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A Clear Vision and Mission:</strong> We need a long-term framework that guides decision-making and policy creation. My vision is for a district where every student – from preschool through graduation – leaves Millburn well-prepared, resilient, and confident.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Process Improvement and Innovation:</strong> No decision or policy is perfect forever. I want to help build systems that regularly review what’s working and what’s not, so we can evolve with the changing educational landscape. These systems must combine a variety of inputs, including objective performance metrics, perspective shaped by real experience, and peer-school analysis to ensure effectiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>A Positive and Supportive Culture:</strong> Everyone, from students to teachers to administrators, thrives in a respectful and uplifting environment. Culture change starts with leadership that models empathy, collaboration, and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> When we engage openly and listen to each other with good intent, we build a stronger district and a stronger community. We are fortunate to have both expert educators and engaged families in Millburn. By listening to and valuing both professional expertise and lived experience, our policies can be forward-looking and responsive to the real-world needs of our students.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="qa">
    <div class="question">TAP: What have you done professionally that will help you as a Board of Education member?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Professionally, my background combines nonprofit leadership, community engagement, and corporate experience, all of which inform my approach to board work.</p>
      <p>Since becoming a parent, I’ve focused my energy on nonprofit and community service. Through my work with the Millburn Education Foundation (MEF) and in multiple PTO executive officer roles, I’ve developed a deep understanding of both the strengths and challenges of our district. As MEF Grants Chair, I’ve worked closely with faculty and staff across every school in the district, building relationships and learning first-hand what’s needed to support student success.</p>
      <p>Leading all-volunteer organizations has also taught me how to bring people together, listen, find common ground, and collaborate toward shared goals. These are essential skills for any BOE member.</p>
      <p>Before my nonprofit work, I was Director of Traditional Construction at GSL Management Corporation, where I specialized in Continuous Process Improvement, Six Sigma, and Just-in-Time production methodologies. That background taught me to question assumptions, analyze data, and constantly look for ways to improve outcomes. I also worked in communications at a Fortune 500 company, where I learned how critical clear, transparent messaging is for building trust and alignment; I would prioritize this on the BOE.</p>
      <p>I believe in this district, its students, and its future. I’m ready to make a meaningful contribution to Millburn’s legacy of educational excellence and help prepare today’s students for tomorrow’s world.</p>
