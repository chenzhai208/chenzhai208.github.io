        <li>Employee spotlight on social media.</li>

      </ul>

        <li>Town Hall Renovation and Addition – talked about for over a decade, now coming to fruition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Statement</h3>
      <p>“I have always cared deeply about our township, and I would like to continue to move Millburn forward in a positive, responsible way. I have proven that I can lead in a bi-partisan manner”, she said.</p>

      <h3>Community Service & Leadership</h3>
      <p>Passionate about the Millburn/Short Hills community, Mayor Romano continues to give back to it in many ways. A community volunteer for the past 30 years, she began to contribute in our schools and for the schools PTO.</p>
      <p>Romano chaired the school districts community outreach efforts including organized food, and toy drives, and was involved with the Millburn/Short Hills chapter of the American Red Cross. She served as a volunteer and later became a staff member serving as the Director of Health &amp; Safety. She worked with the district’s teachers and faculty to make sure everyone was certified annually in CPR and first aid.</p>
      <p>Finally, with the townships’ help, she founded the food pantry and still manages it, a valuable resource in our community.</p>
