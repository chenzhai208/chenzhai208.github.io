      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> 

Her family moved to Millburn in 2013, when her daughters were in preschool and third grade. From the very beginning, they jumped into community life — within our first month, she was serving as a school lunch chair, and her husband, Matt, was coaching a Millburn Rec soccer team. They immediately fell in love with this exceptional town and have been dedicated ever since to helping it remain a special place to raise a family.</p>

<p> Their daughters have gone through Millburn public schools, from elementary through high school. They currently have a sophomore at Millburn High School and a junior at American University in Washington, DC.</p>

<p> Over the years, she has served in leadership roles across many local organizations, including:</p>

<p> Millburn Education Foundation, Co-President, Grants Chair </p>
<p> South Mountain PTO, Co-President, Treasurer, Fundraising Chair </p>
<p> Washington School PTO, Co-President </p>
<p> Millburn Middle School PTO, Co-President </p>
<p> Millburn High School PTO, VP of Programs </p>
<p> Millburn Rec Sports, Softball and Volleyball Coach </p>
<p> South Mountain Neighborhood Watch, Block Captain for Undercliff Road </p>
<p> Millburn PTO Conference, Co-President, Treasurer </p> 

<p> Most recently, she was honored to be appointed by the Board of Education to fill a temporary vacancy through the end of the year. She is grateful for the Board’s trust in me and am committed to continuing to earn that trust through hard work, thoughtful decision-making, and meaningful engagement.</p>
