    <!-- Q1 -->
    <section class="qa">
      <div class="question">TAPinto: Please tell us a bit about yourself.</div>
      <div class="speaker">Cassin:</div>
      <p>My family and I have lived in Millburn since 2018, and my son is currently enrolled in the Millburn public school system. I grew up in Massachusetts and moved to New York in 2003 to attend Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. While my career is based in New York City, I moved to New Jersey in 2007 to support my wife’s professional opportunity — and we ultimately chose Millburn for its outstanding schools and convenient train access to the city.</p>
      <p>I am a Partner at Norris McLaughlin, P.A., a regional law firm with offices in New York City, Bridgewater, NJ and Allentown, PA. My practice focuses on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).</p>
      <p>Both my wife and I have been active volunteers with the PTO and various district events. I’ve contributed especially to the South Mountain School Science Fair and served as a member of the Millburn Education Foundation, where I co-chaired STEAMfest for two years. I have also coached eight seasons of Millburn Recreation youth baseball and served on the Millburn Recreation Commission. In the past two years, I’ve coached an Odyssey of the Mind team, taking the Washington School P1 team to the World Finals in Michigan.</p>

    <!-- Q2 -->
    <section class="qa">
      <div class="question">TAPinto: What do you want to do for the BOE?</div>
      <div class="speaker">Cassin:</div>
      <p>I believe our community is unified by a shared commitment to excellent schools, even if sometimes members of the community differ on how to achieve that goal. I want to help the Board build stronger connections, bridge those divides and continue to strengthen the schools that brought many of us to Millburn.</p>
      <p>To do this, I would focus on thoughtful, detail-oriented policy work, long-term planning and ensuring that changes are deliberate — not reactive — and inclusive of the diverse perspectives of students, teachers, administrators and parents. My priority is ensuring that our schools have the resources they need and that all students have access to a wide range of opportunities that support different learning paths and personal development.</p>

    <!-- Q3 -->
    <section class="qa">
      <div class="question">TAPinto: What have you done professionally that will help you as a BOE member?</div>
      <div class="speaker">Cassin:</div>
      <p>As an M&amp;A attorney, I work in a space where deals only happen between willing parties. I focus on creating win-win outcomes — and I believe that mindset can be applied to public service as well.</p>
      <p>The Board of Education exists to support our schools. While members of the Board and the community may hold differing views on how to best achieve that, I believe those differences can be navigated through collaboration rather than confrontation. I tend to be forward-looking and do not dwell on past choices. I generally give the benefit of the doubt to everyone who chooses to get involved as being well-intentioned. Ultimately, we are all working toward the same goal: strong schools and successful students. I intend to serve with that spirit — bringing people together to support the future of our schools.</p>
