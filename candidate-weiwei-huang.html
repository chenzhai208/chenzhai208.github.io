      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Weiwei Huang is currently a Director at Bank of America, managing compliance and regulatory related risk in the Global Risk Management division. She has twenty years of experience in the financial industry, including the past fifteen at major institutions such as HSBC and Bank of America.

After completing her undergraduate studies in China, she came to the United States on a full scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in physics at the University of Miami. She later earned a second master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business in its top-ranked computational finance program.

In 2020, after fifteen years in New York City, her family moved to Millburn for the same reason as many others: the exceptional quality of our schools. Her son now attends Millburn High School, and they are beyond grateful for the dedication and talent of their educators, who are among the finest in New Jersey and the nation. She is running for the Board of Education to help ensure that the district’s tradition of academic excellence continues for future generations..</p>
