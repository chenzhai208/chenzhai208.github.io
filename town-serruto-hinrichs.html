      <h3>TAP: What do you want to do for the Township Committee?</h3>
      <p>We share the same Vote for Millburn platform as Frank Saccomandi and Ben Stoller have lived up to since 2023.</p>

      <h3>Our Priorities:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce crime, improve pedestrian safety</li>
        <li>Oppose reckless overdevelopment</li>
        <li>Safeguard exceptional schools</li>
        <li>Deal with local issues over party politics</li>
        <li>Nurture our diversity</li>
        <li>Preserve landmarks, history, environment, prevent flooding</li>
        <li>Protect property values</li>
        <li>Never lose sight of our legacy: the children</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If elected, these are the specific things we would have as priorities on the Township Committee:</h3>

      <h4>1. Stop the dump and stop more reckless overdevelopment</h4>
      <p>We need to manage the reckless overdevelopment that was rubber-stamped by a previous township committee through the 2021 Fair Share Housing agreement, complying with Trenton's overdevelopment agenda without fighting for our residents. The previous administrations wrote a blank check to a for-profit developer at residents' expense. Moving forward, we will put guardrails in place to prevent any future sweetheart deals related to our municipal, taxpayer-owned properties. We will also continue the fight to prevent the 75-unit, income-segregated high-density housing development from being built on the toxic DPW Recycling site next to the middle school.</p>

      <h4>2. Actively manage crime prevention and pedestrian safety</h4>
      <p>The Vote for Millburn team of Frank Saccomandi and Ben Stoller pushed hard to ensure that our Police Department took more proactive steps to prevent vehicle theft and home burglaries. This has resulted in a 60% reduction in vehicle theft and 40% reduction in home burglaries. We intend to go further and allocate more resources to crime prevention, such as hiring more police as needed and adding technology that will give our police officers the information they need to catch potential crimes before they occur.</p>
      <p>We will integrate pedestrian and traffic safety into a comprehensive public safety strategy. There are several very dangerous pedestrian crossings that require major changes, such as adding lights, moving sidewalk access and providing crossing guards. Examples that we will target include Glen Avenue and Lackawanna near the Library, the 85 Woodland project being built and the entirety of Old Short Hills Road. Construction should not create traffic and pedestrian hazards as, for example, the 85 Woodland project has. We will always put residents before developers.</p>

      <h4>3. Develop a long-term strategic plan</h4>
      <p>We will put in place a long-term strategic plan for how our town should evolve. We will design processes to ensure current and future township committees adhere to the long-term goals for our town, set by elected officials alongside our community members. Under the majority-Democratic leadership in place for the past eight years, our town has lurched from project to project, with no vision, no priorities and little respect for our taxpayers. Pet projects come out of the blue and are given priority over things like building a long-overdue firehouse.</p>
      <p>We hear a lot about flood mitigation, but the problems have not been solved for the long term. We received a recent grant of $500K to refurbish a pump station that still has useful life remaining, yet Millburn taxpayers send $50 million a year to the county for very little in return. We have given away taxpayer money for a construction project for an entity that we don't own or manage. Special interests have taken priority over the residents.</p>

      <h4>4. Support the Commission Referendum</h4>
      <p>We support the Charter Study Referendum that is on the ballot, which will examine our form of government — the first step toward non-partisan elections. We have always fully supported the move toward a non-partisan form of local government. Local issues have nothing to do with national ones, and we would like to see our Township Committee free from partisan distractions, and totally focused on you, the Millburn residents, property owners and businesses.</p>

      <h3>We are Committed to Millburn's Future</h3>
      <p>We were inspired to run for Township Committee after seeing the positive changes implemented by Frank Saccomandi and Ben Stoller as part of the Vote for Millburn platform. Their leadership brought renewed focus to public safety, responsible development and community-driven governance, reinforcing the importance of fresh perspectives in township leadership.</p>
      <p>"We want to build on the progress Frank and Ben have made," we said. "We are fully committed to the Charter Commission referendum in November, which is the first step toward non-partisan local governance in Millburn. After years of single-party mismanagement, Millburn voters deserve a chance to move beyond party politics toward a more united, locally focused township governing structure. We are delighted that Ben and Frank were able to deliver on this campaign promise," Serruto said.</p>
      <p>"I am serving as President of the Millburn Board of Education and my biggest concern is that the future of Millburn, and thus our schools, is at risk," Heinrichs noted. “I see how single-party rule at the local, county and state levels fails to prioritize our community. We contribute significant tax dollars to Newark and Trenton but see little in return. It's time for leadership that truly advocates for Millburn — it's time to receive the investment, accountability and support we deserve.”</p>
      <p>The disastrous decision to approve a 100% income-segregated housing project on a contaminated dump site remains a stark example of how poor leadership has impacted Millburn's future. Forced on our community in 2021 by then-Township Committee members, without resident input, the project poses serious environmental and safety risks and was further exacerbated by the prior Township Committee's failure to protect Millburn's interests.</p>
      <p>"We want to bring our leadership experience, deep commitment to our community, and in-depth knowledge to finishing the job Frank and Ben started, ensuring our future is defined by our residents and property owners—not by those who neither live here nor invest in our community," Heinrichs added.</p>

      <h3>We will add to the track record of progress.</h3>
      <p>Since being sworn into the Township Committee in January 2024, Frank Saccomandi and Ben Stoller have proven that fresh leadership can bring meaningful change. Their contributions over the past year highlight how new perspectives can make an immediate and lasting impact on the community. Some of their signature accomplishments include:</p>

      <h4>Empowering police to fight crime and improve public safety</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Commissioning a police staffing study to further understand the needs of the department.</li>
        <li>Crime is already down significantly (in 2024, car thefts were down almost 60% and home burglaries down almost 40% from the prior year).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Pushing back on unreasonable Trenton-mandated overdevelopment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading the charge against the ill-conceived 100% income-segregated $50+ million "developer giveaway" project that exceeded Millburn's Realistic Development Potential and was concocted and enabled by prior administrations, who allowed the developer currently suing us to join the lawsuit in 2023.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Respecting residents and encouraging public participation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Restoring the second round of public comment at Township Committee meetings</li>
        <li>Working proactively to ensure that the mismanagement that occurred under single-party rule does not happen again.</li>
        <li>Spearheading the Charter Commission Referendum on the November 2025 ballot, an important campaign promise that will help pave the way to non-partisan local governance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But the job is not done. We're not out of the woods yet — not by a long shot. Continued progress requires more change and more new leadership.</p>
