      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a non-profit organization
       dedicated to encourage youth to 
       empower young people to raise their voices
        and express their opinions on issues 
        that impact their lives.</p>
        
        <p>Accroding to the National Center for 
        Education Statistics(NCES), there are about
        4.25millon registered seniors and about 2 millon sinors 
        have the voting rights. However, young peopleâ€™s 
        electoral participation dropped notably 
        in 2024. After historically high youth 
        voter turnout of over 50% in the 2020 
        presidential contest, our early estimate 
        is that 42% of youth (ages 18-29) voted 
        in 2024 according to The CIRCLE Post-2024 Election Poll .

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Individual Factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Lack of Interest and Attention: Some young people are not interested in political affairs and believe that politics has little to do with their lives, leading to a lack of enthusiasm for voting.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lack of Confidence and Competence: Many young people lack confidence in their ability to successfully navigate the voting process, especially when voting for the first time.</p></li>
        <li><p>Busy Lives: Young people often have busy schedules with school, work, and social activities, making it easy for voting to be overlooked.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Institutional Factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Complicated Registration Procedures: The voter registration rules in the United States vary by state and are often complex. Many young people are unclear about how to register or miss the registration deadline, preventing them from voting.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lack of Convenience: Some states do not offer convenient measures such as same-day registration, early voting, or mail-in voting, making it more difficult for young people to vote.</p></li>
        <li><p>Strict Voter ID Requirements: In some states, voters are required to present specific forms of identification when voting, which can pose additional barriers for young people.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Social Factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Lack of Political Affiliation: Many young people feel that they do not belong to any group that has political influence or can express political demands, which reduces their motivation to vote.</p></li>
        <li><p>Insufficient Information: Some young people report not receiving enough information about voting or being unclear about where they should vote.</p></li>
        <li><p>Weak Civic Education and Media Environment: Civic education in schools often focuses on rote memorization of political, governmental, and historical knowledge, rather than fostering students' political participation awareness and skills. Additionally, a weak media ecosystem can leave young people lacking the knowledge and tools needed to participate in voting.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Economic Factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Economic Stress: Many young people face financial difficulties, such as struggling to meet basic living needs, which makes them more focused on their personal economic situation and relegates voting to a secondary concern.</p></li>
        <li><p>Work and Voting Time Conflicts: Some young people are unable to vote due to work schedules that conflict with voting hours.</p></li>
